** NOT A BUG **

We reported this UM-generated program as a bug to the Frama-C developers:
===
void main() { char a[1][3 % 1] = {'3'}; }
===

The developers response:
"Actually, the code is not well-formed:

the initializer attempts to initialize an array with the scalar '3'


3%1 is 0, so that the inner array is in fact empty

Anyways, the crash is still present for a[2][3%2] = { { '3' } } or a[2][3%1] = { { } } (note that the latter require a gcc machdep such as -machdep gcc_x86_64)
Moreover, the issue only lies with local arrays. Global arrays are perfectly well handled"
=================

Note that: shortly after that the bug report was closed with no fix.
